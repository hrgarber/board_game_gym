3. Consolidate Logs
   - Log files are in the 'logs/' directory.

4. Organize Test Files
   - Test files are in the 'tests/' directory.

5. Consolidate Documentation

6. Organize Source Code
   - Source code is under 'src/'.

7. Consolidate Miscellaneous Files
   - 'requirements.txt' and 'run_tests.py' have been moved to 'scripts/'.

## Remaining Tasks
1. Update .gitignore
   - Ensure .gitignore correctly reflects the new project structure.

2. Review and Update Import Statements
   - Check all files for import statements that may need updating due to the new structure.

3. Update Documentation
   - Update README.md and other documentation to reflect the new project structure.

4. Review CI/CD Configuration
   - If applicable, update any CI/CD configuration files to work with the new structure.

5. Review config/config.py
   - Check if MODEL_DIR path needs updating to reflect the new structure.

6. Create or Update src/__init__.py
   - Ensure proper importing of modules within the src directory.

7. Final Testing
   - Run all tests to ensure the refactoring hasn't broken any functionality.

8. Final Review
   - Conduct a final review of the project structure and make any necessary adjustments.

## Next Steps
1. Address any issues found during the final testing and review.
2. Consider implementing a virtual environment for better dependency management.
3. Update the project's documentation with any new setup or running instructions.
4. Commit final changes and push to the repository.

## Assessment
The refactoring plan has been largely successful in reorganizing the project structure. The new structure improves maintainability and separation of concerns. However, there are still a few tasks to complete to ensure all aspects of the project align with the new structure.
