Current status of errors:

1. SyntaxError in src/utils/hyperparameter_tuning.py:
   - Status: Resolved (no longer mentioned in the test output)

2. AssertionError in test_board_game.py (test_check_blocking_move):
   - Status: Still failing
   - Issue: check_blocking_move(0, 4) returns False when expected True
   - Plan: Review and fix the check_blocking_move method in the BoardGameEnv class

3. AssertionError in test_dqn_agent.py (test_epsilon_decay):
   - Status: Resolved (no longer mentioned in the test output)

4. AssertionError in test_dqn_agent.py (test_target_model_update_frequency):
   - Status: Still failing
   - Issue: Target model weights not updating as expected
   - Plan: Review and fix the update_target_model method in the DQNAgent class

5. AssertionError in test_training.py (test_training_improvement):
   - Status: Resolved (no longer mentioned in the test output)

6. New error: test_visualize_tuning_results in test_hyperparameter_tuning.py:
   - Status: Failing
   - Issue: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'trials'
   - Plan: Review the visualize_tuning_results function and ensure it handles the case when 'study' is None in the results

Next steps:
1. Fix the check_blocking_move method in the BoardGameEnv class.
2. Review and fix the update_target_model method in the DQNAgent class.
3. Update the visualize_tuning_results function to handle cases where 'study' might be None.
4. Re-run tests after each fix to ensure the issue is resolved and no new issues are introduced.
5. If any issues persist, perform more in-depth debugging and possibly add logging to track the problematic values.
6. After fixing all issues, conduct a thorough review of the entire codebase to ensure no new issues have been introduced and all components are working as expected.
