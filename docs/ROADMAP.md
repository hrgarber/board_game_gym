# Board Game Gym Roadmap

## Recent Achievements
- Implemented automatic code formatting using Black
- Updated README.md with current project structure and usage instructions

## 1. Enhance Game Environment
- Implement additional board game variants:
  - Add support for games like Chess, Checkers, or Go
  - Create a flexible framework for easily adding new games
- Improve game visualization:
  - Implement a basic GUI using a library like Pygame or Tkinter
  - Add options for text-based and graphical rendering

## 2. Expand Testing Suite
- Increase test coverage:
  - Add more unit tests for the BoardGameEnv class
  - Implement integration tests for the entire game flow
- Implement property-based testing:
  - Use libraries like Hypothesis to generate test cases
  - Ensure robustness of game logic across various scenarios

## 3. Documentation and Examples
- Improve inline code documentation:
  - Add docstrings to all classes and functions
  - Include type hints for better code understanding
- Create Jupyter notebooks with usage examples:
  - Demonstrate how to use the BoardGameEnv
  - Show examples of game play and analysis
- Maintain up-to-date project structure documentation:
  - Regularly update repo_structure.txt in the docs folder
  - Ensure README.md reflects current project layout

## 4. Performance Optimization
- Profile the code to identify bottlenecks:
  - Use cProfile to analyze performance
  - Optimize critical sections of the code
- Implement more efficient data structures:
  - Explore bitboard representations for game states
  - Optimize move generation and validation

## 5. User Interface Improvements
- Develop a command-line interface (CLI):
  - Implement argument parsing for game settings
  - Add interactive mode for playing games
- Create a simple web interface:
  - Develop a basic Flask or FastAPI server
  - Implement a frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## 6. AI Player Development
- Implement basic AI players:
  - Create a random move player
  - Develop a simple heuristic-based player
- Explore more advanced game-playing algorithms:
  - Implement Minimax algorithm
  - Add Alpha-Beta pruning for improved performance

## 7. Community Engagement
- Set up contribution guidelines:
  - Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file
  - Establish coding standards and pull request procedures
- Implement a plugin system:
  - Allow users to easily add new game variants
  - Develop a standardized interface for AI players

## 8. Logging and Analysis
- Implement a robust logging system:
  - Use the Python logging module
  - Add options for different log levels and outputs
- Develop tools for game analysis:
  - Create functions to replay and analyze games
  - Implement basic statistics tracking (win rates, move distributions)

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize these enhancements:
   - Focus on documentation improvements and maintaining up-to-date project information
   - Continue with expanding the game environment and improving testing
   - Follow with user interface improvements and basic AI players
   - Then move to more advanced features and optimizations
2. Create separate branches for each major feature:
   - Use git branching to isolate each development effort
   - Implement a consistent naming convention for branches (e.g., `feature/chess-implementation`)
3. Regularly update documentation:
   - Keep the README.md file up to date with new features
   - Maintain clear and concise documentation for all new additions
4. Engage with the community:
   - Encourage contributions from other developers
   - Regularly review and incorporate community feedback

This roadmap focuses on enhancing the core functionality of the Board Game Gym, improving its usability, and setting the groundwork for future expansions without relying on reinforcement learning components.
