Board Game Gym Repository Structure Explanation

The repository is structured to separate concerns and promote modularity:

1. src/
   - Contains the core source code of the project
   - Subdirectories:
     - environments/: The game environment (BoardGameEnv)
   - main.py: Entry point for running the game

2. tests/
   - Contains unit tests for various components of the project
   - Helps ensure code reliability and facilitates refactoring

3. config/
   - Contains configuration files for the project
   - config.py: Main configuration file

4. docs/
   - Contains documentation files
   - repo_structure.txt: This file
   - ROADMAP.md: Future plans for the project

5. Root directory files:
   - requirements.txt: Lists project dependencies
   - README.md: Project documentation
   - .gitignore: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore

This structure separates the core logic (src/), testing (tests/), configuration (config/), and documentation (docs/). It allows for easy navigation, maintenance, and scalability of the project.

Future considerations:
1. Implementing a more robust logging system
2. Adding more detailed documentation
3. Expanding the game environment to support different board games
