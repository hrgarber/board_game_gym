Board Game Gym Repository Structure Explanation

The repository is structured to separate concerns and promote modularity:

1. src/
   - Contains the core source code of the project
   - Subdirectories:
     - frontend/: Web-based game interface files (HTML, CSS, JS)
       - Includes index.html, script.js, styles.css, and gameBot.js
     - backend/: Core Python backend code
       - environments/: The game environment (BoardGameEnv)
     - tests/: Contains unit tests for various components of the project
     - scripts/: Utility scripts for running tests and formatting code

2. config/
   - Contains configuration files for the project
   - config.py: Main configuration file
   - pytest.ini: Configuration for pytest

3. docs/
   - Contains documentation files
   - repo_structure.txt: This file
   - ROADMAP.md: Future plans for the project

4. logs/
   - Stores log files generated during runtime

5. Root directory files:
   - requirements.txt: Lists project dependencies
   - README.md: Project documentation
   - .gitignore: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
   - .pylintrc: Configuration for pylint

This structure separates the frontend (src/frontend/), backend (src/backend/), testing (src/tests/), scripting (src/scripts/), configuration (config/), documentation (docs/), and logging (logs/). It allows for easy navigation, maintenance, and scalability of the project.

Key changes in the new structure:
1. Consolidated src/ directory now contains all code-related subdirectories
2. Clear separation between frontend and backend code
3. Tests moved closer to the code they're testing
4. Scripts consolidated into src/scripts/

Future considerations:
1. Implementing a more robust logging system
2. Adding more detailed documentation
3. Expanding the game environment to support different board games
4. Improving the frontend-backend integration
5. Adding containerization for easier deployment and development
