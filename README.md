# Board Game Gym

## Overview

Board Game Gym is a reinforcement learning environment for training AI agents to play board games. This project aims to create intelligent game-playing agents using various reinforcement learning techniques.

## Features

- Custom board game environment
- Implementation of AI agents (specific types to be determined)
- Flexible architecture for adding new games and agents
- Test suite for ensuring code reliability

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/board_game_gym.git
   cd board_game_gym
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Game Logic

The `src/game.py` file contains the core game logic for the board game. It includes:

- A `BoardGame` class that represents the game state
- Methods for making moves, checking for winners, and resetting the game

To play the game or integrate it with AI agents, you can import and use the `BoardGame` class from `src/game.py`.

## Usage

(To be updated with specific usage instructions as the project develops)

## Running Tests

To run the tests:

```
python -m pytest tests/
```
