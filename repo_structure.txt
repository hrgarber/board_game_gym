Board Game Gym Repository Structure Explanation

The repository is structured to separate concerns and promote modularity:

1. src/
   - Contains the core source code of the project
   - Subdirectories:
     - agents/: Implementations of AI agents (Q-learning, DQN)
     - environments/: The game environment (BoardGameEnv)
     - utils/: Utility functions and helper modules

2. tests/
   - Contains unit tests for various components of the project
   - Helps ensure code reliability and facilitates refactoring

3. notebooks/
   - Jupyter notebooks for interactive development and visualization
   - Useful for training, hyperparameter tuning, and result analysis

4. game_files/
   - Contains files related to the web-based game interface
   - Includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files

5. models/
   - Directory for storing trained model files

6. Root directory files:
   - main.py: Entry point for running the game or training
   - requirements.txt: Lists project dependencies
   - README.md: Project documentation
   - .gitignore: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore

This structure separates the core logic (src/), testing (tests/), experimentation (notebooks/), and user interface (game_files/). It allows for easy navigation, maintenance, and scalability of the project.

Future refactoring could consider:
1. Separating the web interface into its own module or subproject
2. Creating a dedicated config directory for hyperparameter configurations
3. Implementing a more robust logging system
4. Adding a documentation directory for more detailed guides and explanations
