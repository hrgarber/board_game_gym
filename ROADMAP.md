## Next Steps
1. Prioritize these optimization strategies:
   - Start with hyperparameter tuning and reward shaping as they can have significant impact
   - Follow with algorithm enhancements (Double DQN, Dueling DQN)
   - Then move to advanced techniques like parallel training and curriculum learning
2. Create separate branches for each major optimization:
   - Use git branching to isolate each optimization effort
   - Implement a consistent naming convention for branches (e.g., `opt/hyperparameter-tuning`)
3. Implement and test each optimization incrementally:
   - Set up a standardized testing framework to compare performance
   - Use the same random seeds for fair comparisons
4. Regularly benchmark and compare results:
   - Create a `benchmark.py` script to evaluate agent performance
   - Record key metrics: win rate, average reward, training time
   - Generate plots to visualize improvements over baseline
5. Update documentation with findings and best practices:
   - Maintain a `RESULTS.md` file documenting the outcome of each optimization
   - Update the main README with the most successful optimizations
   - Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` guide for future development best practices
