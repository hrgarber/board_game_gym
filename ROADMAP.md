# Optimization Roadmap

## 1. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Implement grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization
- Tune learning rate, discount factor, epsilon values, and decay rates
- Create a separate script for hyperparameter optimization

## 2. Network Architecture Optimization (DQN)
- Experiment with different neural network architectures
- Try various activation functions (ReLU, LeakyReLU, ELU)
- Implement batch normalization and dropout

## 3. Experience Replay Improvements
- Implement prioritized experience replay
- Optimize replay buffer size and sampling strategy

## 4. Advanced Exploration Strategies
- Implement UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) or Thompson Sampling
- Explore intrinsic motivation or curiosity-driven exploration

## 5. Algorithm Enhancements
- Implement Double DQN
- Experiment with Dueling DQN architecture
- Try SARSA or Actor-Critic methods

## 6. Multi-step Learning
- Implement n-step Q-learning or TD(Î»)

## 7. Reward Shaping
- Fine-tune the reward function

## 8. State Representation
- Experiment with different state encodings or feature extraction methods

## 9. Parallel Training
- Implement parallel training using multiple environments

## 10. Transfer Learning
- Develop pre-training on simpler tasks

## 11. Curriculum Learning
- Design a curriculum of increasing difficulty

## 12. Code Optimization
- Profile code and optimize critical sections
- Implement vectorized operations where possible

## 13. Hardware Utilization
- Ensure efficient GPU utilization
- Experiment with mixed-precision training

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize these optimization strategies
2. Create separate branches for each major optimization
3. Implement and test each optimization incrementally
4. Regularly benchmark and compare results
5. Update documentation with findings and best practices
