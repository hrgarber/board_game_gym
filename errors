Errors identified and plan to address them:

1. SyntaxError in src/utils/hyperparameter_tuning.py:
   - Issue: 'return' statement outside of a function
   - Plan: Review the file and ensure all 'return' statements are within functions. 
     Remove or properly place the orphaned 'return' statement.

2. AssertionError in test_board_game.py (test_check_blocking_move):
   - Issue: check_blocking_move(0, 4) returns False when expected True
   - Plan: Review the check_blocking_move method in the BoardGameEnv class. 
     Ensure it correctly identifies blocking moves, especially for the case (0, 4).

3. AssertionError in test_dqn_agent.py (test_epsilon_decay):
   - Issue: Epsilon not decreasing after decay
   - Plan: Review the epsilon decay mechanism in the DQNAgent class. 
     Ensure the decay is applied correctly and the test is calling the decay method.

4. AssertionError in test_dqn_agent.py (test_target_model_update_frequency):
   - Issue: Target model weights not updating as expected
   - Plan: Review the update_target_model method in the DQNAgent class. 
     Ensure it's called at the correct frequency and properly updates the target model weights.

5. AssertionError in test_training.py (test_training_improvement):
   - Issue: DQN agent not showing improvement after training
   - Plan: Review the training process for the DQN agent. 
     Ensure the agent is learning effectively and the test is allowing enough episodes for improvement.

Next steps:
1. Address the SyntaxError in hyperparameter_tuning.py as it's preventing other tests from running.
2. Fix the issues in the order listed above, starting with the BoardGameEnv class.
3. Re-run tests after each fix to ensure the issue is resolved and no new issues are introduced.
4. If any issues persist, perform more in-depth debugging and possibly add logging to track the problematic values.
