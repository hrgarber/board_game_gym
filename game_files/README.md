# Board Game Project

This directory contains the files for our Board Game project.

## Files

- `gameBot.js`: Contains the main game logic for the Board Game.
- `gameBot.test.js`: Contains the test suite for the Board Game logic.
- `styles.css`: Contains the styles for the game's user interface.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that renders the game in a web browser.
- `game_bot.py`: A Python version of the game bot (not currently in use).
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for handling user interactions and updating the UI.

## Running the Game

To run the game, open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command in the terminal:

```
npx jest
```

Make sure you have Jest installed as a dev dependency in your project.

## Development

When making changes to the game logic, make sure to update the tests in `gameBot.test.js` accordingly. Always run the tests before committing changes to ensure the game logic is working as expected.

## Future Improvements

- Implement AI player using the `game_bot.py` file.
- Add more advanced game features and rules.
- Improve the user interface and styling.
